## Tailored to Your Needs. Continuously Refined.
People come in all shapes and sizes. So it only makes sense that we all have
different nutritional needs. Hyperion.ai figures out exactly what your body
needs. By continuously collecting data about your health and running it through a neural
network, Hyperion.ai learns about how your body is responding to the supplements
and will make adjustments accordingly. And as your needs change, Hyperion.ai automatically
adjusts and refines your custom vitamin formula.

## How it Works.

- Fill out a survey about your current health and health-related goals.
> Before signing up, simply fill out a short survey to get started.

- Download the Hyperion.ai app on your favorite platform's app store and
optionally, add your desired health tracking integrations.
> Integration with fitness tracking devices (e.g. HealthKit, Fitbit, Jawbone) is
highly recommended. However, Hyperion.ai will still be effective without the
additional data. If you don't have a smartphone, or prefer to use the web, all
features will also be available through our web interface.

- You will receive a month's supply of the initial vitamin formula.
> For your convenience, each dosage will be sealed individually. Take each dose
once per day unless otherwise directed.

- Depending on your preferences&mdash;ranging from nightly to weekly&mdash;answer
the prompts from the Hyperion.ai app.
> Hyperion.ai will ask you questions based on the goals you set. For instance, if
you felt tired all day, Hyperion.ai

- Hyperion.ai will automatically analyze your results and adjust the vitamin
formula accordingly before sending out another month's supply.
> From there the cycle repeats itself. Our AI adjusts your vitamin formula
dynamically as your requirements and health conditions change.
